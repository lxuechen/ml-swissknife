# ml-swissknife

Reusable ML research primitives for fast prototyping.

Slowly porting and refactoring lots of stale code from many past projects.

## Installation

To install the stable release, run the command below.

```bash
pip install ml-swissknife
```

I occasionally may forget to push the latest release onto pypi, in which case running the command below will always
ensure that the latest repo is installed.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/lxuechen/ml-swissknife.git
```
